### Knuths
Modern Fiisher Yates Shuffle: This algorithm, described by Donald Knuth in his book "The Art of Computer Programming," generates random permutations by swapping elements in a clever way to achieve uniform distribution.

### Genres
The Genre-Aware Shuffle uses the Fisher-Yates Shuffle and incorporates genre-based sorting using Spotify's genre data. Based on the given probability, the shuffled playlist is adjusted: with 100% probability, songs of the same genre are clustered together, while with 0% probability, songs of the same genre are dispersed. Note that Spotify's genre data may be incomplete, which could affect the sorting accuracy.

### Recent
The Recently Listened Shuffle builds on the Fisher-Yates Shuffle and sorts songs based on your last 150 listened songs. Depending on a given probability, the shuffled playlist is adjusted: with 100% probability, recently listened songs are placed at the beginning of the playlist; with 50% probability, they are interspersed with songs you haven't listened to recently; with 0% probability, they are placed at the end of the queue.

### Authorization flow 
with access tokens to fetch user playlists and track metadata. Display custom queues with song previews, album art, and metadata. Automatically deploy custom queues to Spotify. User Interface: Preview various shuffle types and configurations before selecting the final queue. Color palette options include purple, green, black, and white.

### Other
Supports for multiple browsers and device dimensions. 
Saves only minimal user data so the app can work.

# Open Source
This app is entirely open source on GitHub, and private Spotify keys and user data are properly secured on the deployment version. (https://github.com/Rembolt/Django-Spotify-API-App/)

## Server Configuration
If you are curious to know how the server is configured, let me give you some info:

The Server is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and has a DNS link to the actual domain. The project is wrapped on Docker for volume handling and management of:
 	-Certbot, taking care of the HTTPS certification process.
-A reverse proxy using NGINX that manages:
-ssl certification ( and HTTPS HTTP control)
-communicates UWSGI workers
 -Django app running with:
 -WSGI
-Whitenoise to handle Static files (and Media)
-Support for Postgres DataBase
 -PostGress as designated Database
	
Django communicates with the Spotify API through its views and saves only minimal user data so the app can work.

Your assistance is much appreciated.


## Potential Future Features
### Musicality shuffle
Utilizes clustering and distance algorithms (like Fisher-Yates and K-means) to provide genre grouping, mood clusters, artist proximity, and even ‚Äúmusicality‚Äù grouping, all to create a highly personalized queue experience.

### Proficient Error Handling
Even though the app has error handling to help the user and developer understand what went wrong, currently, the app does not cover all possible error results.
