### Knuths
Modern Fiisher Yates Shuffle: This algorithm, described by Donald Knuth in his book "The Art of Computer Programming," generates random permutations by swapping elements in a clever way to achieve uniform distribution.

### Genres
The Genre-Aware Shuffle uses the Fisher-Yates Shuffle and incorporates genre-based sorting using Spotify's genre data. Based on the given probability, the shuffled playlist is adjusted: with 100% probability, songs of the same genre are clustered together, while with 0% probability, songs of the same genre are dispersed. Note that Spotify's genre data may be incomplete, which could affect the sorting accuracy.

### Recent
The Recently Listened Shuffle builds on the Fisher-Yates Shuffle and sorts songs based on your last 150 listened songs. Depending on a given probability, the shuffled playlist is adjusted: with 100% probability, recently listened songs are placed at the beginning of the playlist; with 50% probability, they are interspersed with songs you haven't listened to recently; with 0% probability, they are placed at the end of the queue.

### Authorization flow 
with access tokens to fetch user playlists and track metadata.
Display custom queues with song previews, album art, and metadata.
Automatically deploy custom queues to Spotify.
User Interface: Preview various shuffle types and configurations before selecting the final queue. Color palette options include purple, green, black, and white.
